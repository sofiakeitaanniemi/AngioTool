# AngioTool development project
AngioTool is a lightweight software for quantitative analysis of angiogenesis. It provides free, open source tools for quantitative assessment of various vessel morphometric and spatial parameters including vessel length and density, branching index, lacunarity, etc. AngioTool allows for robust analysis through an user-friendly interface.  

## Development aims 
The aim of this project is to develope AngioTool to analyze multiple pictures in parallel.  

### Targets:  
1. Analysis of multiple pictures in parallel. 
2. Parameters for analysis are set for each picture beforehand. 
3. Analysis of high resolution pictures.
